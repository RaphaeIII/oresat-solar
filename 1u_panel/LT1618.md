# Linear LT1618>"The LT1618 step-up DC/DC converter combines a traditional voltage feedback loop and a unique current feedback loop to operate as a constant-current, constant-voltagesource...The currentsense voltage is set at 50mV and can be adjusted using theIADJ pin."Some Features we Like: - Massive Vin range (1.6V to 18V) - Operating range of -40 to 85 deg C - 1.5 MHz operating range - Current adjust pin that lets us define an I for CC mode or output at CV mode## Design Inputs- Solar cells (assuming PEP cover)    - Voc = 5.45 V and Isc = 244 mA   - Vmp = 4.85 V and Imp = 231 mA => Pmp = 1.12 W## Components - TBD## How is this a MPPT? The LT1618 is capable of both CC and CV modes, where the I for the CC mode is selected via an analog voltage on the Iadj pin (pull to ground for CV).  We already have a V/I sensor along with an M0 microcontroller onboard the panel assembly.  The V/I sensor will constantly be reporting the output of the solar panels to the M0 over I2C, the M0 will calculate the MPP and output an analog voltage to the Iadj pin (via an external I2C DAC) to define a CC output that corresponds with the MPP.
