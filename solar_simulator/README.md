# Solar SimulatorNOTE: This page is a WIP, contact [David Lay](https://github.com/davidalay) with any questions## The Problem:  AKA Oh dear god why is everything so expensiveBecause we wanted to test our solar panels in our thermal vacuum chamber, we needed a solar simulator that could simulate the AM0 light spectrum while also being compact, power efficient, and (most importantly) cheap!<br /> Normal incandescent solutions were too bulky to fit in our tiny vacuum chamber,they require a lot of power, and dissipate a whole lot of heat into the system.  LED solutions do exist, but they are insanely expensive. So-being the loveable open source rogues that we are- decided to build our own!<br /> ## The DesignWe are only using three LED channels for our design (R, G, and B) most commercial simulators use way more channels than we do, but because our panels have a relatively flat response curve, we think we can get away with just 3.  Each channel is composed of CREE X-QE LEDs, because they are insanely small and power efficient and come in the wavelengths that we need.  Each channel is driven by an LM3404HV LED driver, since they can push stupid amounts of power at a very high frequency.  Each channel is in parallel and requires 70V 1A, meaning that the Vpp must be capable of 70V 3A. (NOTE: We could get away with lower voltages, but using 70V allows us to use a higher switching frequency (1.2 MHz).
